    "The main differences between supervised and unsupervised learnings are :\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Complexity: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine learning, typically calculated through the programs like R or Python. In Unsuprvised learninng , powerful tools are required for working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised models are computationally complex because they need large training set to produce intended outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Drawbacks: Supervised models can be time consuming to train, and the labelds for input and output require expertise. Unsupervised models can canhave wildely inaccurate results unless you have humann intervntion to validate the output variables.\n",
